# 🕷️ PortSwigger Web Security Academy — Lab Walkthroughs by shadow

Welcome to my personal documentation of the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) labs. This repository is a curated collection of detailed walkthroughs, exploit techniques, and remediation strategies for each lab I've completed.
